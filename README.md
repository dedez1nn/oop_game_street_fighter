A project developed by me and my classmate for the **Object-Oriented Programming** subject on College using **Python 3** and **Pygame**.

## 🎮 Project Description

This is a small fighting game inspired by **Street Fighter**, developed as our first project using **OOP in Python**.  
The goal of the project was to implement:

- ✅ Enemies with **two different behaviors**  
- ✅ **Two independent elements** in the scenario  
- ✅ **Sound effects** triggered by one or more actions  
- ✅ **OOP pillars**: inheritance, polymorphism, operator overloading, and exception handling  

We had **1 month** to develop it from scratch, and we are happy with project!  
There is still a lot to improve, but it's a solid start as the first project for me using Python and Pygame.
